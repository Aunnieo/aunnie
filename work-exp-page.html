            I helped open the first Chick-fil-A in Boston, and that experience truly shaped my approach to leadership. I trained staff in professional development, emphasizing positive work habits and a customer-centric mindset. Supervising over 20 team members and assigning roles based on individual strengths taught me how to make decisive decisions and adapt in a rigorous environment. I deeply loved how the company pushed customer values, and the experience played a huge role in growing my managerial character.

            This summer, I interned as a Summer Technology Intern with UP Education Network—overseeing UP Academy Boston, the same middle school I attended over six years ago—and gained invaluable insights into how technology supports academic environments. As a Boston native, I witnessed firsthand how segregation contributes to disparities in funding, performance, and resources in our schools, yet it was incredibly inspiring to see UP’s unwavering commitment to providing quality education. Having experienced both public and charter schools, and with my two younger brothers currently navigating the same system, I deeply care about ensuring the best possible education for Boston’s youth.
